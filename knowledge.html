        <button class="accordion">High School</button>
<div class="panel">
            <p>In high school, I have learned a lot about technology. I have started to learn different programming languages and have learned multiple different subjects centered around customer support. Aside from computer skills, I have improved in many essential skills. These skills include time management, communication, leadership skills, and many processes that improve my work efficiency 
            </p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">College</button>
<div class="panel">
            <p>While at college, I hope to increase my knowledge of computers in general. Technology has been a huge part of me, so learning new skills and fine tuning what I already know is what I want to do through my entire life. I plan on taking many different classes, but mainly sticking with classes related to the Information Technology field.
            </p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Outside School</button>
        <div class="panel">
                <p>Much of what I know has come from lessons outside of school. I have gone through many online lessons, videos, texts, etc. to learn new things. These things I have learned has ranged from learning basic programming, to running and maintaining my own servers for my family and friends. Other than online sources, I have also learned a lot from trying things on my own. Video games have been a huge inspiration for me to learn more about technology, so a lot of what I know now has stemmed from working on video games.
